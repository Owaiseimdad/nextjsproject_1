## GenBlog is my first Next Project.

To implement the application first download the files and then execute teh command below

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)/or any port which is specified in the terminal once you execute it.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
